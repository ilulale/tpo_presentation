              - Its both time and knowledge based test
              - There are various sections , each usually refering to a single area to be tested. I'll suggest to divide the time and move to the next section promptly.
              - Coding questions are usually at the end so it helps to reach there with some time to spare.
              -There might be a restriction of sharing time between sections.

            - For LTI , there are 3 coding rounds
            - As you progress the questions get tougher in each round.
            - The number of rounds that you clear indicate the package/position you get.

            - Whenever you start a round have a look at all the questions befor you start coding.
            - Once you come up with an approach , the test will also require you to confirm to the time and space constraints.
            - You are allowed to use the language of your choice, so go with one which will help you solve the problem the fastest (Python).
            - Read up on common questions asked and optimal approaches for them ,[codechef](https://www.codechef.com/practice?page=0&limit=20&sort_by=difficulty_rating&sort_order=asc&search=&start_rating=0&end_rating=999) is an excelent resource.
            - Use the run test case option in the editor to quicky debug your attempt.

              - It is a one on one interview where they judge your skills according to the branch they are considering you for.
              - Pay attention during the pre placement talk.
              - They usually begin with the question 'Tell us about yourself'
                - Use this as an opportunity to tell them about all the different skills you've picked up
                - Also present a clear and concise resume , detailing all the courses/workshops/internships you've attended

              - Keep all of your projects ready somewhere ([github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)), as you may need to demo or share it
              - Use your projects to show that you can handle complex systems and concepts.
